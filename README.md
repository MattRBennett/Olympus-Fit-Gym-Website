# Olympus Fit Gym Website

**Background:**

As a personal project I created a gym website to practice my HTML/CSS skills. This project was just to practice my basic front-end skills, the website does not contain any JavaScript.

**About the project:**

This was my first project that involved my own creative mindest. In this project I was tried to explore more into CSS styling; playing more with colour variations, flex, button animations and navbars. I looked at popular gym websites to gain and idea of what they wanted on their main page. Many of which started of with a banner image and some form of inspirational quote, and followed with a gym locator or gym list and some quick links to other areas of their site.
